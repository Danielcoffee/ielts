# Everyday
*Osho - There is no tomorrow*

- It is just a consequence of being silent and in tune with existence: Love arises in you, life becomes abundant, laughter for no reason, just because this whole existence is so hilarious.

- Follow your natural, and drop all conditionings, programs that have been given to you by others. This make you totals.

- Get comfortable with being uncomfortable

- Confidence, I believe, is something that you need to develop.

- But when you develop that skills, when you develop that competence, when you're good at what you do, you feel good about what you do,
you do more what you do, and people tell you that you're fucking good. of course, guess what. Then you get more and more confidence.

- Do not think that, you have to stay in this relationship because you spend so many years, years mean nothing. NOTHING. If the situation is not bringing you happiness.
